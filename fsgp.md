## Single Occupant Class

In the Single Occupant Class vehicles are scored solely on laps completed. The team with the most laps (minus penalty laps) at the end of the three days wins!

## Multi Occupant Class

In the Multi-Occupant Class vehicles are scored on a number of factors including:
- Total Person Laps (each additional passenger in the vehicle for a compeleted lap earns an additonal person lap)
- Target Speed (teams must average at least 30mph, if they do not their score is reduced)
- External Energy Usage (MOV cars can charge from non-solar sources, the amount of charging factors into the score)

### Scoring Formula
At FSGP the MOV Score (S) is calculated as follows: **S = (D / E) x C x T**

The variables are as follows:
- **D** - Total Personal Miles (Person Laps * 2.5 miles) minus penalty miles
- **E** - External Energy Used in kWh
- **C** - Completion Factor as a percentage of the highest miles completed by any team
- **T** - Target Speed derating. For teams averaging below 30 mph their score is exponentially derated based on their average speed
