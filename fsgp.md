## Multi Occupant Class

In the Multi-Occupant Class vehicles are scored on a number of factors including:
- Total Person Laps (each additional passenger in the vehicle for a compeleted lap earns an additonal person lap)
- Target Speed (teams must average at least 30mph, if they do not their score is reduced)
- External Energy Usage (MOV cars can charge from non-solar sources, the amount of charging factors into the score)

### Scoring Formula
At FSGP the MOV Score (S) is calculated as follows: **S = (D / E) x C x T**

The variables are as follows:
- **D** - Total Personal Miles (Person Laps * 2.5 miles) minus penalty miles
- **E** - External Energy Used in kWh
- **C** - Completion Factor as a percentage of the highest person miles completed by any team
- **T** - Target Speed derating. For teams averaging below 30 mph their score is exponentially derated based on their average speed
