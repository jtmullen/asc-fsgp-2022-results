## Scoring 

The 2022 Event is once again a distance-based competition. The primary goal is to compelete the 1470 mile base route, however teams will have numerous opportuntities to complete additional optional loop segments to gain addition miles (or person miles for Multi-Occupant Vehicles) which will help increase their ranking. 

Distance completed will be updated at each stage stop & checkpoint. Official time, penalties, and MOV score will be updated at the end of each stage. 

### Single Occupant Vehicle (SOV) Class
The single occupant class is scored solely on miles driven. The team that completes the most miles will win the event. Stage winners are also determined by miles driven on that stage. In the event of a tie, elapsed time is the tie-breaker. 

### Multi-Occupant Vehicle (MOV) Class
Multi-Occupant vehicles are scored on a variety of factors including person-miles driven, their practicality score, amount of external energy used, and whether they maintain the 35mph target speed. For the overall event winner all of these factors are used. For individual stage winners only person-miles and target speed are considered. See our [vehicle classes](https://www.americansolarchallenge.org/the-competition/vehicle-classes/) page for more info on class scoring.
